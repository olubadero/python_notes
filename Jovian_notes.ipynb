    "This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai) (don't worry if these terms seem unfamiliar; we'll learn more about them soon). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n",

    ">  **Jupyter Notebooks**: This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of _cells_. Each cell can contain code written in Python or explanations in plain English. You can execute code cells and view the results, e.g., numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files, etc. instantly within the notebook. Jupyter is a powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't be afraid to mess around with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encountering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top."

    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n",

    "- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n",

    "- Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n",

    "- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n",
